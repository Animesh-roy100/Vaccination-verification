# Vaccination-verification

# About The Project:
  In this project, we are going to create a Model that will check the necessity of vaccine for a specific user on the basis of certain parameters and details that are given by the user. And we will perform NLP on the dataset to analyze the sentiment of the user texts if it is a verified user or not, This project can be used for the current covid pandemic situation.
